# JChat
A simple free messaging client
Built on the Java language, it is easy to run and bypasses proxy's and web filters.

Points of consideration:
1. All files for the application are small, everything if not most of the handling is done by the server. More customization is avaliable with the server version
2. If you want to download and use the program, DO NOT USE SERVER FILES. These are for if you want to run the application on a server, and then remote connect
