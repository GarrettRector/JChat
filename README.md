* Full GUI Support expected to be complete by July 28th
* [API](#api) Support expected late august

# API
A JChat [API](https://github.com/GarrettRector/JChatAPI) is expected to come by late august, and can be used to make bots. It currently only supports the main chatroom, but will support custom hosted ones later

# JChat
A simple free messaging client
Built on the Java language, it is easy to run and bypasses proxy's and web filters. It was mainly created as a communication protocol for me and friends at school where many platforms are blocked, but can be used by anyone

## Required Libraries:
  1. [Apache Commons CSV Parsing](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/download_csv.cgi)
  2. [Apache Commons String Parsing](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi)

# Commands
The valid commands are right now:

`login, Username, Password`

`msg, User Message, Content`

`join, Groupchat name`

`leave, Groupchat name`

`quit, logoff or logout`

Do note that the commas are not part of the commands, they just signify the seperation between terms.
